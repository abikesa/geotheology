_Geopolitics: Resources, Needs, Costs, Supply, Demand_. Everyone is talking about "Chinese efficiency" but the reality is more like "American corporate inefficiency". What mattered most to Big Tech was not the AI product itself, but the fact that it kept their wallstreet ponzi scheme going. The skyrocketing stocks, the billions in government funds, the gradual tech dystopia they were creating. Those were the features, not the flaws and bugs.

## Part of the reason is I set up processes

"People used to ask me, Why was I calm during the presidency? In addition to being from Hawaii, which really helped (we're just chill)," he joked, "part of the reason is I set up processes. So by the time I made a decision, I might not get the outcome I wanted, but it might be a 51-49 decision, or a 60-40 decision, but I can say I heard all the voices involved -- gotten all the info, seen all the perspectives -- so when I made decision, I was making it as well as anybody could make it."

1. Logit function, y. Realise there's no right answer -- it's about weighing the odds.
2. Not geniuses, but l'homme moyen -- workers, laborers. Listen to the people who will be most affected by the change.
3. Counterfactual vs. Agentic (This is his point of view). Get outside the 'bubble' of people who are 'supposed' to advise you; Test your B.S. detector.
4. Seek out the naysayers; reweighting even within the tribe
5. Error, Loss function, back-propagation. Insist that people deliver bad news quickly and are not punished for honest mistakes.
